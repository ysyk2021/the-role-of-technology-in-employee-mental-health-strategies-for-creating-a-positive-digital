Providing Digital Resources

Providing digital resources is a technique for leveraging technology to support employee mental health.

Leveraging technology to support employee mental health should be integrated into an overall mental health strategy to ensure that it aligns with organizational goals and objectives. This integration may involve partnering with mental health professionals, developing policies and procedures for using technology to support mental health, and promoting the use of digital resources, teletherapy and telemedicine services, and digital mindfulness techniques through ongoing communication and education.

**Conclusion**

Leveraging technology to support employee mental health can be achieved through providing digital resources, offering teletherapy and telemedicine services, promoting digital mindfulness, and integrating these techniques into an overall mental health strategy.
