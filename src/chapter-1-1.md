==========================================================================

**Overview**

In recent years, employee mental health has become a critical issue for employers across the globe. The increase in workplace stress and burnout, coupled with the rise of technology in the workplace, has led to a greater focus on promoting positive mental health among employees. This chapter aims to define the importance of employee mental health and its impact on the workplace.

**Defining Employee Mental Health**

Employee mental health can be defined as an individual's emotional, psychological, and social well-being in the workplace. It encompasses how an employee feels about their work, their relationships with colleagues, and their overall sense of purpose in their role. Poor mental health can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including absenteeism, low productivity, and high turnover rates.

**The Impact of Employee Mental Health on the Workplace**

When employees experience poor mental health, it not only affects them but also their colleagues and the wider organization. A culture of stress and burnout can spread quickly throughout a workplace, leading to a decrease in morale and motivation. In contrast, promoting positive mental health can lead to a more engaged and productive workforce. Employees who feel valued and supported are more likely to be committed to their roles and perform at a higher level.

**Conclusion**

It is clear that employee mental health is a critical issue for employers to address. By promoting positive mental health in the workplace, organizations can create a more productive and engaged workforce. In the following chapters, we will explore the role of technology in promoting employee mental health and strategies for creating a positive digital workplace.
